# Hometask on course Basic Deep Learning at VK MADE Academy.
The task is about solving OCR problem for captchas.   
My solution is partially based on [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05717.pdf).  
All necessary scripts are in directory ```utils```.  
Dataset is available [here](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/JQn56xLQ_3QPHw)
