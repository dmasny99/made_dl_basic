# Hometask on course Basic Deep Learning at VK MADE Academy.
Task: solve OCR problem for captchas.   
My solution is partially based on [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05717.pdf).  
All necessary scripts are in directory ```utils```:
* ```utils/dataset.py``` - file with dataset;  
* ```utils/model.py``` - file with OCRmodel;  
* ```utils/utils.py``` - file with useful utils;
* ```utils/train.py``` - file with training script;  
Experiments were coducted in ```ocr solution.ipynb```, so find results there. Final CER on test data was around $5.3%$.
Dataset is available [here](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/JQn56xLQ_3QPHw)
